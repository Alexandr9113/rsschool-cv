### About me

I graduated from the university with an education in economic security, and after that I realized that a job in my specialty was not suitable for me. I got a job just so I wouldn't have to ask my parents for money. The work is not bad (there is a lot of free time that can be usefully used), but it is poorly paid, and I would also like to work from home, since it is inconvenient to wake up 3 hours before the start of the working day, then stand at least 1.5 hours in traffic. Therefore, I decided that it was worth changing something in my life. A colleague advised me to take free courses at the RS-school, but the course started in July, and I started stage 0 in September, which is why I could not catch up with the program. But I didn't want to stop there, so I can attribute perseverance and perseverance to my merits, punctuality can also be noted (even if I overslept the alarm clock, I will do everything not to be late for work), I keep track of the schedule and try to meet all deadlines.
I am very interested in learning, as I need to improve my living conditions. I used to work part-time at a programming school and I became interested in website development, so I already have some experience in programming.

1. python - telegram bots
2. C# - game development in unity
3. JavaSkript - I only know the basics, since I started learning this language at stage 0

      count = count + 1;
    }
    i = i + 1;
  }

  return count;
};
```
